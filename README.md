<p align="center"> Welcome to AstralGate, a cryptocurrency payment gateway. </p> </div>

## About The Project

As part of the "Simulated professional work" in the third year at Epitech. I decided to take inspiration from the platforms "Coinbase Commerce" and "Stripe" in order to create my own payment portal in cryptocurrency dedicated to traders. It aims to offer traders an easy way to integrate crypto payments into their online trading platform.
